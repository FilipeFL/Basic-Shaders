# Basic-Shaders
Some shaders that I had developed for a course project, at PUC-MG. The shaders are a Force Field, Electric and Reflective, plus they were made using shader graph or script.

Notice that the zip contains a Unity Package file and prints from the shader.
As well, the files names are in portuguese, I will check on this in the future for a better understanding.
